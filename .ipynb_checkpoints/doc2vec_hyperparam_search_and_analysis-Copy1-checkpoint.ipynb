       "[\"Though made in Canada , `` Overdrawn at the Memory Bank '' traces its roots to the BBC school of film production . Using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you 're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked . Raul Julia plays Aram Fingal , a drone data processing worker for Novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority . Caught watching `` Casablanca '' on his desk monitor , Fingal is sentenced to `` doppling '' rehabilitation -- he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon . -LRB- How exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody 's guess . -RRB- As it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy 's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it . As time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on ... while Fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there 's no better way to hack the system than from the inside . During the chaos , computer technician Apollonia James -LRB- Linda Griffiths -RRB- maintains contact with Fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings . Over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance . Given that `` Casablanca '' is Fingal 's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to `` Casablanca '' . In fact , the Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre characters make appearances -LRB- played by Julia in a dual role and Louis Negin , respectively -RRB- in a bar called `` The Place '' . Julia 's portrayal of Bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the `` schweethaat '' - spouting parody seen in cartoons . Negin 's Peter Lorre is quite credible , and easily the best Peter Lorre I 've ever seen who was n't the real thing . The two of them , as characters created by Fingal 's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system . Those are n't the only Casablanca characters to put in appearances . The Sydney Greenstreet character also happens to be around ... as `` The Fat Man '' , the alternate aspect of the film 's main villain , the Novicorp Chairman -LRB- Donald C. Moore -RRB- . While Fingal 's body is lost , the Fat Man tries to stop him from hacking the system ... with less than salutory results . It 's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition . Words like `` dopple '' , `` psychist '' , `` computech '' , `` cinema '' , and `` reconst '' are apparently in common use . And while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past 's idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of `` virtual reality '' today . As cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it 's definitely recommended viewing . The special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television . The music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but is n't really out of keeping with the genre . However , the writing quite makes up for it . There are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen `` Casablanca '' to appreciate properly .\",\n",
       " \"People who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . Often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . In such cases , mistakes are understandable-genre boundaries are never clearly marked . But , I believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . Such thing occurred in former Yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to THE RIGHT STUFF , 1983 film directed by Philip Kaufman . The mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . But THE RIGHT STUFF film is n't even fiction . It was based on the non-fiction book by Tom Wolfe , covering the early years of American space program . The plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of Edwards Air Force Base , major test site for experimental planes . The major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reachMach speed and thus break the sound barrier . Many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . But one quiet pilot , Chuck Eager -LRB- played by Sam Shaped -RRB- succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . Ten years later , Soviets have launched `` Sputnik '' marking the beginning of the Space Age . In order to regain national prestige , US government decides to be the first to send man into space . Best Air Force , Navy and Marine pilots are recruited into program , but not Yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-American image . In one of critics ' polls THE RIGHT STUFF was named as one among topfilms made in 1980s . Such high position could be explained with the fact that Kaufman 's film looks quite atypical for its time . With more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s-age when Hollywood used to make films larger than life . But the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . Philip Kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that Golden Age in order to create original , memorable movies . THE RIGHT STUFF was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking `` artsy '' projects . THE RIGHT STUFF is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of Hollywood film . The plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in Yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . The film also lacks conventional protagonist-Yeager -LRB- who also appears in small cameo -RRB- remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . That gave opportunity for Kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . Sam Shepard is great as Yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement-breech of the sound barrier-remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . On the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but Shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . Shepard 's performance is followed with great acting by Ed Harris as clean-cut Marine -LRB- and future politician -RRB- John Glenn . Young Dennis Quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock Gordo Cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of Virgil Grissom , superbly played by Fred Ward . Always reliable character actor Scott Glenn provides some comic relief as Navy aviator and -LRB- arguably -RRB- first American man in space Alan Shepard . Kaufman left room for female talents to excel too-Barbara Hershey , Pamela Reed , Veronica Cartwright and Mary Jo Deschanel are great as pilots ' wives . Royal Dano is also impressive as menacing figure of Preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to Donald Moffat as Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson and Jane Dornacker as Nurse Murch . Great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with Kaufman 's superb direction . Most notable of all is the methods Kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . The beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . Everything seems natural-Yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . In that setting , it 's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . But the times are changing ; WW2 alliance with USSR is replaced with Cold War , and `` natural '' pilots like Yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . Their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists -LRB- like former Nazi rocket expert Werner von Braun , played by Scott Beach -RRB- only to preserve their most basic human dignity . This contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence-while Yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , `` Mercury '' astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . Those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with Kaufman 's superb use of poetic movie language . Editing is great , and photography by Caleb Deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion -LRB- the same image would be copied in many latter films -RRB- . Although Kaufman enjoyed support of NASA and American military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . Those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to CGI and real footage of Earth from outer space . Another fine contribution of this film is `` Oscar '' - awarded musical score by Bill Conti ; I still tremble from excitement every time I hear it . It is accompanied with the use of Holst and Debussy . Some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . This film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . Some of the `` Mercury '' astronauts are n't fleshed out enough -LRB- although being played by fine actors , like Lance Henriksen -RRB- . Film also lacks proper closure . On the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film-landing on the Moon-would require this film to be more than six hours long . Also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too Amerocentric and hard on Russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent Cold War rhetoric of Reagan 's America . In some of contemporary interviews , Kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed Russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by Americans in early 1960s . Time has passed ; now we do n't see astronauts as heroes . In this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . Few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . But this film , sentimental reminder of the times `` when future began '' , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow `` Mercury '' astronauts ' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . And even if they decide to stay on Earth , they could still appreciate THE RIGHT STUFF as an extraordinary piece of cinema .

       " \"With three pre-to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for -- cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at Little League practice and pick-ups from ballet practice -- Margaret Hall 's life is rife with complications . And with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the North Atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , Margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . But Margaret 's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . Her teenage son Beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into Wesleyan University 's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . His mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of Tahoe City , California to the sprawling urban metropolis of Reno , Nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended Beau . `` Stay away from my son '' Margaret warns Darby Reese . Her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as Reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging Beau to join him in the boathouse . There are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and Beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated Reese tumbles out of sight . The next day , on her morning walk , Margaret discovers Reese 's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . With her maternal instincts working overtime , Margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . But Margaret 's life is about to get a lot more complicated . Soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman 's line , Margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red Nova . Alek Spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of Beau to the police unless Margaret comes up with $ 50,000 by o'clock the next day . But Margaret 's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for Alek turns out to be something she never expected . Based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding 's novel `` The Blank Wall , '' `` The Deep End '' is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel -LRB- `` Suture '' -RRB- . It makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast -- Goran Visnjic plays Alek with a suave likeability , Jonathan Tucker shines as the conflicted Beau , Peter Donat is amusing as grandfather Hall , and Josh Lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless Darby Reese . The film is also lovingly photographed by Giles Nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy Peter Nashel . But it owes everything to British actress Tilda Swinton . Swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of Derek Jarman 's films -LRB- `` Caravaggio , '' `` Edward II , '' `` The Last of England '' -RRB- , plays Margaret Hall in `` The Deep End '' and , like Charlotte Rampling in this year 's `` Under the Sand , '' turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . Margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and Swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . The role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . Many can relate to that , of course ; it 's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one 's son that Swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . The end is deep all right , and there is n't a single shallow moment in Tilda Swinton 's canon . Got beef ? Visit `` La Movie Boeuf '' online at -LSB- 1 -RSB- http://members.dca.net/dnb\",\n",
       " \"A miracle of filmmaking , `` Some Like It Hot '' is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists . It is the pinnacle of writer-director Billy Wilder 's career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make . Jerry -LRB- Lemmon -RRB- and Joe -LRB- Curtis -RRB- are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves . One night , as they 're playing at a banned Prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided . As it turns out , the owner , Spats Columbo -LRB- George Raft -RRB- was ratted out by Toothpick Charlie -LRB- George E. Stone -RRB- . Several weeks later , on Valentine 's Day , Jerry and Joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of Charlie by Columbo in a parking garage . Eager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in Florida with all expenses paid . The only catch . . its a girls band . So Josephine -LRB- Curtis -RRB- and Daphne -LRB- Lemmon -RRB- , make their way onto the train and go to Florida . On the way there , they meet Sugar Kane -LRB- Monroe -RRB- , a bombshell singer who is looking for love . Jerry and Joe immediately fall for the singer , but there 's two problems : 1 -RRB- they 're in drag , and 2 -RRB- millionaire Osgood Fielding -LRB- Joe E. Brown -RRB- falls madly in love with Daphne . What follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of Spats Columbo to Florida for the `` Italian Opera Lovers Festival '' . Tony Curtis is hysterical as Joe/Josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo Sugar . Marilyn Monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is Sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity . The scenes , however , are all stolen by either Brown or Lemmon . Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne . Cast as the less rational one , Lemmon 's performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all Billy Wilder 's . Brown is particularly hilarious as Osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony . He manages to use Lemmon 's ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire . Every set-piece is flawless , as Wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture . Wilder 's script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness . Wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film . Wilder 's is dead wrong when he says nobody 's perfect : Billy Wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny . Nobody 's perfect but Billy Wilder .\",\n",
       " \"Stendhal 's Syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . Grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from Italy 's master of the horror thriller Dario Argento . Boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music Ennio Morricone , THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a quite magnificent return to form for Argento . It follows his disappointing American debut TRAUMA -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , the patchy OPERA -LRB- 1987 -RRB- and several mediocre films he produced for young Italian director Michele Soavi in the late 1980 's . Based on the novel by Graziella Magherini , the film stars Argento 's daughter Asia as young Roman police inspector Anna Manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . Visiting Florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer Alfredo -LRB- Thomas Kretschmann -RRB- to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . At the gallery Anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . Posing as a bystander , Alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . A gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with Argento 's often lumpy narratives . THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . It is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character 's psychological disintegration . The script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . But as dark as its themes are , THE STENDHAL SYNDROME emerges as one of the most artful and effective European thrillers of the last ten years . Argento is once again working in his native Italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . Effects whiz Sergio Stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is consistently excellent . The film 's openingminutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . Proof that , at his most inspired , Argento remains one of the world 's most exhilarating filmmakers . The cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into English that renders speech all but emotionless . Asia Argento 's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . It 's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . Thomas Kretschmann is chillingly effective as Alfredo , and Marco Leonardi -LRB- of CINEMA PARADISO , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in Italy -RRB- does okay as Anna 's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . But perhaps THE STENDHAL SYNDROME 'S single most striking element is Ennio Morricone 's soundtrack . Active since the 1960 's , Morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . It 's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . It 's been three decades since Argento and Morricone worked together . This is a long welcome reunion . If the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film does n't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . But by the closing scenes , THE STENDHAL SYNDROME has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of Dario Argento 's career . * NOTE : See the uncut print from Japanese laserdisc if you can .
